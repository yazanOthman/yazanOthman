## 🚀 Projects

### 🌐 Phone store
A React web application that offers a seamless shopping experience by displaying a curated list of phones. Users can explore detailed information about each phone, add items to their shopping cart, and complete purchases with PayPal integration. The application efficiently manages state and business logic using the Context API, and data is loaded locally for quick access and performance.

### 🩺 Resort App
A feature-rich React web application designed for exploring and booking resort accommodations. The app displays a comprehensive list of rooms, allowing users to view detailed information about each room, including amenities and availability. Integrated with Contentful, a powerful headless CMS, the application enables real-time updates of room data and content. The app also includes a dynamic filter functionality, allowing users to easily search for rooms based on type, space, and available perks to find the perfect accommodation.

### 📉 Pantry Tracker
A full-stack application using TypeScript, Next.js, Express, Node.js, and MongoDB. It is designed to help users manage their pantry inventory efficiently. Users can easily add, delete, and update the quantity of products, with items automatically organized by category for streamlined management.
